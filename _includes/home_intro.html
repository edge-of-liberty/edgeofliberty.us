    <h2>Come Spend Sundays with Us at The Edge of Liberty Craft Fair!</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>    
    <p>Every other Sunday from Mother’s Day to Halloween, we bring together <strong>local artisans, fresh food, and community spirit</strong> in a lively outdoor market on the edge of Liberty Township, just north of Valparaiso. <strong>Wander through a vibrant mix of handmade goods, unique art, and farm-fresh products</strong>, enjoy <strong>live music and karaoke</strong>, and grab a bite from our <strong>featured food truck</strong>.</p>

    <p>On the Sundays in between, our <strong>farm stand</strong> is open with <strong>organically grown, seasonal produce, herbs, and edible flowers</strong> picked fresh just for you. <strong>Explore our garden walks, nature trails, fish pond, and apiary</strong> while soaking in the fresh air and good vibes.</p>

    <p>We’re all about creating a <strong>welcoming space</strong> where everyone can <strong>connect, shop, and celebrate the simple joys of life.</strong> Whether you’re here to support local artists, stock up on fresh food, or just enjoy a beautiful Sunday outdoors, <strong>you’re part of what makes this place so special.</strong></p>
