<p><strong>Thank you to our community sponsors.</strong> Your support helps keep vendor fees affordable, ensures our events remain free to attend, and makes it possible for small businesses, nonprofits, and independent makers to thrive.</p>

<p>A Craft Fair Community Sponsorship is a season-long show of support — not a sales booth. Sponsors receive a professionally printed lawn sign displayed at every Edge of Liberty Craft Fair throughout the 2026 season, placed in high-visibility areas like entrances, parking zones, and walkways.</p>

<p>This is community patronage, not pushy advertising. Sponsorships provide consistent local visibility while helping preserve the welcoming, family-friendly atmosphere that makes our fair special.</p>
