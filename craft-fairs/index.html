  <section class="faq-item">
    <h2>What is the history of the Edge of Liberty Craft Fair</h2>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>The Edge of Liberty Craft Fair began in 2020 as a way for neighbors to share their lockdown crafts and safely socialize outdoors. We called them “Open Farm” events and hosted them alongside our existing Market Days at Batshit Crazy Farms.</p>
      <p>For the first three years, we held monthly craft fairs, limited to friends, neighbors, and returning Market Days customers. In 2023, we opened participation to home-based artisans from Porter County and surrounding areas, expanded to a bi-weekly schedule, and somehow pulled off twelve events in one season.</p>
      <p>We survived—and, call us crazy, we did it again in 2024, kicking off the season on Mother’s Day and hosting 13 events.</p>
      <p>2025 is already in full swing with another 13-event season. All that’s missing is you!</p>

    <h2>What’s the goal of the Edge of Liberty Craft Fair?</h2>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Our goal is to offer an affordable, supportive venue where home-based entrepreneurs can build their brand, connect with customers, and gain the confidence to “go pro” with their craft.</p>
      <p>We’ve been on that journey ourselves—starting out as a market garden and food vendor with no idea how to tackle things like signage, credit card readers, social media, or online stores. All we wanted to do was make good stuff and share it. We know how overwhelming those first steps can be.</p>
      <p>That’s why we created this community—and this website. As part of the Edge of Liberty family, your business benefits from the traffic we drive to our shared site. We feature vendor profiles with images and links to your website, Facebook page, or shop (if you have them). If you don’t? No problem. Use this space to test the waters, meet customers, and see if this is something you want to pursue more seriously.</p>
      <p>One of the best parts of being here is learning from others. You’ll be surrounded by professionals who might seem like competitors but act more like mentors—happy to share, support, and celebrate your progress.</p>
      <p>Already a pro? We’d love to have you too. We’re one of the few Sunday markets in the region, perfectly placed for leisurely drives and post-church visitors drawn in by our iconic Bible verse sign. Our booth fees are low, our turnout is strong, and your experience will help lift the whole community.</p>
      <p>We’re a family of makers, growers, and dreamers—bringing beauty into the world, joy into our community, and value into every connection. When people buy from people, it’s not just about money. It’s about happiness on both sides of the table. That’s the freedom we’re chasing—and we’re inviting you to help us tip it over the edge.</p>

    <h2>What vendors will I see when I visit the Edge of Liberty Craft Fair?</h2>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Explore this website to see who’s part of the Edge of Liberty community!</p>
      <p>• The Home page lists all vendors who have reserved spaces for this year’s events. Each listing includes whatever contact info we have—website, Facebook, shop links—so you can connect with them anytime.</p>
      <p>• The “Dates” menu links to all upcoming events, each with a list of vendors who’ve committed to that date.</p>
      <p>• After each event, we update the Home page with vendor info and photos when available, so you can still check out who was there even if you missed it.</p>
      <p>We also keep vendor profiles up for about a year after their last fair, so it’s easy to find and support past participants.</p>

    <h2>Why would I want to visit the Edge of Liberty Craft Fair?</h2>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>We’re one of the only Sunday markets in the area—and while you’ll see some familiar faces from other fairs, our setting is something special. It’s more relaxed, more personal, and more community-focused. Our vendors have time to chat, share their process, and talk about the art they love.</p>
      <p>You’ll also meet new makers—neighbors and friends testing out their ideas and building confidence as first-time entrepreneurs. Your encouragement helps them grow.</p>
      <p>But this isn’t just a craft fair—it’s a day out:</p>
      <p>🌿 Explore our gardens – Let us harvest fresh herbs, greens, and flowers for you from our formal beds</p>
      <p>🌳 Wander the trails – Enjoy informal plantings and quiet paths through the woods and around our private pond</p>
      <p>🐟 Feed the fish – Watch the catfish and bass come up for feeding time at 2pm</p>
      <p>🍓 Pick your own fruit – Over at the Create Happiness House, our u-pick orchard includes strawberries, blueberries, and peaches (with apples and pears coming in 2026)</p>
      <p>🎤 Join us for karaoke – It’s real, it’s fun, and yes, it happens</p>
      <p>🐝 Visit our apiary – See our bees in action and learn more about local pollinators</p>
      <p>🌱 Tour the community garden – See what your neighbors are growing and get inspired to try it yourself</p>
      <p>Our farm stand offers freshly picked, pesticide-free produce, our Batshit Crazy signature pepper blend, and fruit jams and jellies from our mini orchard.</p>
      <p>You can also book a private tour of the farm anytime at edge-of-liberty.com/private-tours.</p>
      <p>Whether you come to shop, explore, sing, snack, or just slow down—you’ll find something (and someone) worth visiting.</p>

    <h2>⚠️ Vendor Scam Warning ⚠️</h2>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>We are currently under attack from scammers impersonating us in other vendor groups and via private messages. They’re using Gmail addresses like craftartsfestival@gmail.com and asking vendors to send money via Venmo, CashApp, or Zelle.</p>
      <p>Please do NOT send money to anyone claiming to represent our event unless you’ve verified it’s through our official site.</p>
      <p>✅ All legitimate signups go through:</p>
      <p>👉 https://batshitcrazyfarms.com</p>
      <p>We never collect booth fees through Gmail, Venmo, or CashApp.</p>
      <p>We only communicate with confirmed vendors via:</p>
      <p>• Email from @batshitcrazyfarms.com, @edge-of-liberty.com, or @edgeofliberty.us</p>
      <p>• Our private vendor Facebook group</p>
      <p>• This website</p>
      <p>If you’re ever unsure—ask first. We’d rather double-check than have anyone get scammed.</p>
      <p>Let’s keep each other safe.</p>
