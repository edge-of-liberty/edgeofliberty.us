I am happy to introduce my line of hand-crafted lotions, body butters, creams and soaps. All of my products have been personally hand crafted in a controlled, safe and sanitary environment and are in compliance with and exceed the State of Indiana’s safety and compliance standards, which include post production testing. This ensures all my lotions, creams and body butters have been made safe and free of bacteria and mold. My products are made by blending high quality butters, essential and carrier oils, fragrances, extracts and other natural ingredients, to produce products that are creamy and soothing for even the driest of skins. For those whose skin has suffered under the harsh Indiana weather, I have a wonderful skin cream to ease those itchy days, as well as a soothing cream for dry and cracked feet, both of which my husband loves. My family and friends from Indiana and across the country have been my test subjects for the last four years and have told me they love my final creations. I am proud and happy to bring those to you today. I love them and I am sure you will too.
